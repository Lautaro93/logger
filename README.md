Logger tool developed in Python 3, using pyinstaller for distribution in .exe format.

Though to be used with PSoC and RN2483, the logger can record in parallel the output data of 3 UARTS (is tought for the RX and TX of RN2483 LoRa module and the "stdout" of the microcontroller, in the example a PSoC).
